## Project Description
In recent times, event planning can get convoluted and people can get confused as to when is what or what they have to bring. There's been several times when I have tried to plan events with friends, where some may be lost as to what the exact precise details are and there can endless times of tagging people in the group chat. So, this project will incorporate not just messaging but other accessory features as well such as creating the event right then and there in the group chat and the event would be create on Google Calendar. Another feature can be dedicating tasks to certain group mates, so no one has room to mess up.
